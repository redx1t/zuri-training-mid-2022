##### Task 2

Using JavaScript, create a "date-matching" application that has the following features:

Three lists containing names (Group A, Group B and Places), the list can be represented with Object or Array.
The application should randomly match and produce 2 people at each refresh.
The result produced should be in the format:
Group A['name'] and Group B['name'] will be going on a dinner date at Places['name'].
However, the program should go through the entire list in Group A before repeating names.
